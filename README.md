# Self-implementation-of-a-backpropagation-algorithm
<p align="justify">The current repository contains different notebooks, in which functions are implemented in Python from scratch, to understand the basic steps to carry out a machine learning problem.</p>

## Getting Started

<p align="justify">These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.</p>

### Prerequisites

<p align="justify">You need Python 3.x to run the following code.  You can have multiple Python versions (2.x and 3.x) installed on the same system without problems.</p>

In Ubuntu, Mint and Debian you can install Python 3 like this:

    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    
For other Linux flavors, OS X and Windows, python is availabe at http://www.python.org/getit/.  


## File descriptions
<ul>
<li>The files "iris.csv" and "winequality-white.csv" which correspond to the 2 datasets used in the different notebooks.</li>
    
<li><div align="justify">"Open_conversion_data.ipynb" is the first Jupyter notebook of the series, which treats of the initial operations to be done to read the data from a CSV file, modify the variable types in the different columns (features) of the dataset, as well as data re-scaling, such as normalization and standardization.</div></li>
    
<li><div align="justify">"Split_dataset.ipynb" is the second Jupyter notebook of the series, where 2 approaches to split a dataset are implemented, to understand how the split between training and testing occur for machine learning problems.</div></li>

<li><div align="justify">"Performance_assessment.ipynb" is the third Jupyter notebook of the series in which, accuracy metrics to measure machine learning algorithms performance are introduced, and implemented in a simple way.</div></li>
</ul>
